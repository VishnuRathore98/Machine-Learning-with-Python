# Machine Learning with Python

This repository contains my journey of learning machine learning with Python. I'm focusing on implementing various concepts and algorithms to gain a practical understanding.

## Completed:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for machine learning models.
- **Regression:** Building models to predict continuous target variables.
- **Classification:** Building models to predict categorical target variables.
- **Clustering:** Unsupervised learning techniques for grouping data points.
- **Association Rule Learning:** Finding relationship between variables in dataset.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Training agents to learn through interactions with an environment.
- **NLP:** Using NLP for customer review sentiment analysis
- **Deep Learning:** Implementing neural networks for complex tasks.
    - **Artificial Neural Networks**
    - **Convolutional Neural Networks**
    - **Principal Component Analysis(PCA)**
    - **Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)**
    - **Kernel PCA**
- **Model Selection and Boosting:** Techniques for deciding which model to choose, and how to boost the performance.
    - **Model Selection:**
        - **K fold cross validation**   
        - **Grid Search**
    - **Boosting:**
        - **XGBoost**
        - **CatBoost**
