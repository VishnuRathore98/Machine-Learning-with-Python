# Machine Learning with Python

This repository contains my journey of learning machine learning with Python. I'm focusing on implementing various concepts and algorithms to gain a practical understanding.

## Completed:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for machine learning models.
- **Regression:** Building models to predict continuous target variables.
- **Classification:** Building models to predict categorical target variables.
- **Clustering:** Unsupervised learning techniques for grouping data points.
- **Association Rule Learning:** Finding relationship between variables in dataset.

## In Progress:

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Training agents to learn through interactions with an environment.

## Upcomming:

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques for reducing the number of features in a dataset.
- **Deep Learning:** Implementing neural networks for complex tasks.
